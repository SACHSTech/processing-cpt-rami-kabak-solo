# Pixel Patty

A delightful 8-bit burger shop game that combines pixel art with fast-paced interactivity of running your own Burger Joint! 

The objective of the game is to manage the burger shop, giving customers the ingredients that they want on their burgers, some weird, some wacky, but the responsibility still lies on you to fullfill their orders!

The scoring system is based on the restaurant rating, you cannot gain it, but you can lose it! It's like the lives you get in a game. As I said there are multiple ways to lose it, if a customer gets impatient and leaves you will lose a rating. If you click a wrong ingredient you will lose a rating, if you reach below 2 stars you will lose the game.

There aren't any limitations, the program is designed to do exactly what it was meant to do.

The concept of a Burger Shop game as a whole is a very broad topic, as it requires the user to not only focus on the design and imagery used but also the systems implemented into the game. Thus, given the time, Pixel Patty could be made into a full fledged game, but for now it sort of resembles a demo with the aim of demonstrating the skills that were aquired in ICS3U, don't get me wrong, it still follows a story-line and allows the user to win, but the actual play-time isn't that high in the game.

I personally focused more on the design aspect of the game featuring many sprites and characters and thus time management became a problem which explains the lack of content as the game was supposed to have 10 DAYS but only ended up having 3, as I would've needed way more characters and more implementations into the code.
